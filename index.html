                        <p>I was born in Ohio, had several years of moving around the United States with military
                            parents,
                            and moved back to Ohio again in time to graduate high school. I met my future husband when
                            we
                            were set up on a blind date for Homecoming in my junior year of high school. We went to
                            college together at
                            The Ohio State University and got married a week after graduation.</p>

                        <p>At OSU, I earned 2 BA degrees in History and English, but had no interest in teaching or
                            graduate school. My real passion was writing, and I had a vague dream of being in
                            publishing. Before I could start a career, my new husband's job took us to
                            Washington DC, Germany, then Seattle in a span of 3 years. Just long enough to set my career
                            goals adrift. I began working in retail until I had my first child. Now, with two children
                            ages 6 and 4, it is time for a new chapter.</p>

                        <p>My full time job is stay-at-home parent. It is the most exhausting job I've ever had, but
                            very rewarding in its own ways. With my youngest set to start Kindergarten in the fall of
                            2021, it is time to focus on other projects as well.</p>
                        <p> I am enrolled in a Trilogy cirriculum coding boot camp through the University of Washington.
                            Less than a month in, I am already well on my way to becoming a front end developer. The
                            goal is to be a full stack developer by the end of the course in June. I will be completing
                            several projects throughout, which I will post here. To date, I have covered these major
                            topics:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HTML</li>
                            <li>CSS</li>
                            <li>Bootstrap</li>
                            <li>Javascript</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This page is a project to showcase a responsive portfolio using Bootstrap (v4.5). Notice the
                            responsive images and text as you resize your browser window or view the page on different
                            devices. It is all possible with the power of CSS, but made much more developer friendly
                            thanks to Bootstrap. Please visit the portfolio page for screenshots of my projects and
                            links to the deployed application, if available.</p>
